Enables support feature for using Less in a theme.

== Description ==
Using [Less](http://lesscss.org) when developing a theme can both enhance the code and speed development. However, setting up Less in a theme every time (not to mention updating Less for all the themes) can make the time saved futile.

This plugin solves that issue.
